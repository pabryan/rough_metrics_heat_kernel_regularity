We consider smooth manifolds equipped with rough metrics
we demonstrate the existence of globally continuous
heat kernels that are locally HÃ¶lder. This is done 
by employing local Harnack estimate for weak
solutions of divergence form elliptic equations
with bounded measurable cofficients in weighted Sobolev
spaces.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The existence and regularity of heat kernels on smooth manifolds, with smooth (or even continuous)
metrics is now a classical fact (c.f. \cite{}). However, there has been
little in the way of investigation
of this topic for metrics beneath continuous coefficients. 

A wide and useful class of potentially discontinuous metrics are called \emph{rough metrics}, 
which are guaranteed to have only measurable coefficients, and they are Riemannian-like in the sense
that they are locally bounded above and below almost-everywhere by a smooth metric.
These metrics became of interest as geometric invariances of the Kato square
root problem, particularly in the non-compact setting, in \cite{BMc, BRough}. 
In the compact case, these metrics were used to study regularity properties
of a geometric flow, weakly tangential to the Ricci flow, 
in \cite{BLM, BCont}. 

Since the manifolds we consider are smooth (topologically), we always have an 
exterior derivative. Moreover, rough metrics, like their classical continuous
or smooth counterparts, induce a canonical volume via the 
experssion $d\mu(x) = \sqrt{\det g(x)} dx$ for rough metrics $g$.
Moreover, the exterior derivative is a closable object
in $\Lp{2}(M)$, which allows us to construct Sobolev spaces $\SobH{2}(M)$ 
and $\SobH[0]{2}(M)$. Here the  
former space is the  energy for the Neumann Laplacian
and the latter for the Dirichlet counterpart.
With respect to these Laplacians, we can now ask
whether a heat kernel exists, and how regular one
can expect such an object to be. In the setting of rough metrics, our main theorem
is the following. 

\begin{thm}
On a smooth manifold \(M\), equipped with a rough metric \(g\), there exists a 
minimal heat kernel \(\rho_t = \rho_t(g)\), such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\rho_t > 0\) for \(t > 0\),
\item on a parabolic cylinder \(Q = K \times [t_1, t_2]\) with \(0 < t_1 < t_2\), \(K \subseteq M\) is compact, there exists an \(\alpha = \alpha(Q)\) so that \(\rho_t \in C^{\alpha}(K \times K)\) for \(t_1 \leq t \leq t_2\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}



Note that heat kernels have been considered
for some time in more general settings than smooth Riemannian manifolds,
with the bulk of the literature focusing on metric spaces with bounds
on certain synthetic notions of curvature.
Many classical results can be recovered from this general 
theory since smooth (or continous) metrics induce an associated intrinsic
distance structure. A priori, there is no reason
why a rough metric should induce a canonical distance structure - at least
this cannot be done via minimisation over curves since the
length functional may not be a well-defined device. 

The significance of our results in this paper is to demonstrate
the construction of heat kernels in this setting where we may 
not have a canonical distance but instead, we have well-defined Laplacians. 
Unlike in many classical treatments which construct the \emph{minimal} 
heat kernel via local-to-global methods, our construction is purely global.
It is likely that in many instances we are sacrificing minimality but if we fix
an energy space, we are obtaining an object that is unique to that energy.

The former set of methods typically yeild a so-called minimal heat kernel,
but additional assumptions, such as a lower bound on Ricci curvature,
is assumed in order to obtain its uniqueness (see \cite{Chavel}).
More seriously, the following Varadahn's formula
$$ d^2(x,y) = 4 \lim_{t \to 0} t \log \rho_t(x,y)$$
may fail for this minimal heat kernel. It is well known that
for the heat kernel corresponding to Dirichlet Laplacian, i.e., 
with energy in $\SobH[0]{2}(M)$, this formula holds.
We emphasise that in our situation, we do not have the luxury of a distance,
but we are essentially approaching the problem from the other
end where we have the energy spaces as natural objects.

The method of constructing the global heat kernel
via Riesz representation methods is made known to us by
the book of Davies in \cite{Davies}.
In \cite{BCont} where the manifold was assumed to be compact, 
the existence and regularity of the heat kernel was
reduced to \emph{Harnack estimates}, which were
furnished by observing that  
the rough metric was globally comparable to a smooth metric
due to the compactness of the underlying manifold and
through the  results of Sallof-Coste in \cite{SC}.
In our situation, these results do not apply without additional assumptions
and so instead, we demonstrate
how to obtain the heat kernel via \emph{local Harnack estimates}.

\section{Rough Metrics}
\label{sec:rough_metrics}

The term ``rough metric'' was coined in \cite{BRough} as they were 
recognised to be the geometric invariances of the Kato square root problem.
We emphasise here that similar notions existed implicitly in the 
literature with the work of Norris in \cite{Norris} 
and \cite{SC} by Saloff-Coste.
The treatise of rough metrics we give here is rudimentary and 
a more detailed exposition is avaiable in section 3 in \cite{BRough}. 
We begin with the following definition, which recognises
that a manifold affords us not only with a metric independent 
differentiable structure, but also a metric independent measure
structure.

\begin{defn}
Let \(M\) be a smooth manifold. A set \(E \subseteq M\) is said to be \emph{Lebesgue measurable} if for all charts \(\varphi : U \subseteq M \to V \subseteq \R^n\), the set \(\varphi(E \cap U)\) is a Lebesgue measurable set of \(\R^n\).
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
The Lebesgue measurable sets form a \(\sigma\)-algebra. The notion of Lebesgue measurable set does not involve a measure on \(M\). 
However, if \(\omega\) is volume \Rd measure \Bk on \(M\) associated to a smooth or continous metruc, then it defines a (outer) measure \(E \mapsto \int_E\ d\omega\) for which the \(\sigma\)-algebra of measurable sets is precisely the \(\sigma\)-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets.
\Rd This can be seen by considering charts that are compact and observinv that \(\omega\) is absolutely continuous with respect to the pullback of the Lebesgue measure inside that chart. \Bk
\end{rem}

Given that we have a metric independent measure structure, we can say that a function
$f: M \to \R$ is measurable if $f^(-\infty, \alpha]$ is measurable for every $\alpha  \in \R$.
Clearly, this extends to functions $f:M \to \C$ and on letting
 $T^{p,q}M$ denote the bundle of $(p,q)$ tensors of covariant rank $p$ and contravariant rank $q$,
we can consider measurable sections and we denote the set of such 
sections by $\Gamma(T^{p,q}M)$. 

\begin{defn}
A \emph{rough} metric \(g\) is a Lebesgue measurable section of \(\met(M) = (T^{\ast} M \odot T^{\ast} M)_+\), the bundle of positive definite, symmetric bilinear forms on \(TM\) that is \emph{locally comparable}: there is an open cover \(\lbrace U_{\alpha} \rbrace\) of \(M\), smooth metrics \(g_{\alpha} \in \met(U_{\alpha})\) and real constants \(C_{\alpha} > 0\) such that
\[
\frac{1}{C_{\alpha}} g_{\alpha} (X, Y) \leq g(X, Y) \leq C_{\alpha} g_{\alpha} (X, Y)
\]
for all tangent vectors \(X, Y \in TM\).
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
By employing a partition of unity argument, we can patch together the metrics \(g_{\alpha}\) to produce a globally defined metric \(h\). If the constants \(C_{\alpha}\) are uniformly bounded above and away from zero, then our rough metric will be globally comparable to \(h\). This is automatic whenever \(M\) is compact. If \(M\) is not compact, then this need not be true. Previously a Harnack inequality and heat kernel estimates have been obtained when the metric is globally comparable to a complete metric with bounded below curvature \cite{SC}. Here we do not require the assumptions of global comparability.
\end{rem}

Given a rough metric, we may locally define a \(g_{\alpha}\)-self-adjoint, measurable section \(A_{\alpha} : U_{\alpha} \to T^{1,1}U_{\alpha}\) by
\[
g(X, Y) = g_{\alpha} (A_{\alpha} (X), Y).
\]
Moreover, via the expression $d\omega_g(x) = \sqrt{\det g_{ij}(x)}\ dx$, where $dx$ is the pullback
Lebesgue measure inside precompact $U_\alpha$, we obtain a well-defined volume measure. 
A set $S \subset M$ is measurable if and only if it is $\omega_g$-measurable. This yeilds 
an $\Lp{p}$-theory over the $T^{p,q}M$ tensor bundle simply via the expression:
$$||\xi||_p^p := \int_{M} |\xi|_{g}^p\ d\omega_g < \infty$$
for $p \in [1, \infty)$ and via
$$||\xi||_\infty := \inf\set{C: |\xi|_g \leq C\ \text{a.e.}}.$$

\section{The Laplacian of a Rough Metric}


For a smooth function \(f \in \C^{\infty}(M)\), write \(\nabla f = df\) for the differential of \(f\). 
The differential \(\nabla : C^{\infty}(M) \to \Gamma^{\infty}(T^{\ast} M)\), maps smooth functions 
\(C^{\infty}_0(M)\) to smooth one-forms \(\Gamma^{\infty}_0(T^{\ast} M)\). 
We emphasise that this object is only dependent on choice of differentiable structure on $M$,
which we assume to be fixed and a part of the data specifying $M$ as a manifold. 

Recall that in the classical smooth setting, the Laplacian acting on functions can be 
written via the expression $\Delta_g = - \tr \nabla^2$, where $\nabla^2 = \nabla^{T^\ast M} \comp \nabla$
with $\nabla^{T^\ast M}$ the Levi-Cevita connection. Indeed, for rough metrics, 
or even for a continous metric, it doesn't make sense to talk of the Levi-Cevita connection, 
and this expression does not survive. Therefore, we understand this operator
in an appropriate weak sense.

First, we observe that for a rough metric $g$, the operator
$\nabla_2 := d_2: \Ck{\infty} \cap \Lp{p}(M) \to \Ck{\infty} \cap \Lp{p}(T^\ast M)$
is closable, as well as $\nabla_c := d_c = d_2$ with $\dom(d_c) = \Ck[c]{\infty}(M)$,
for $p \in [1, \infty)$
Therefore, we can define first-order Sobolev spaces
$$ \Sob[0]{1}(M) := \dom(\bar{\nabla_c})\quad \text{and}\quad  \SobH{1}(M) := \dom(\bar{\nabla_2},$$
with the Sobolev norm $||u||_{\SobH{1}} = ||u||_2 + ||\nabla u||_2$
as function spaces $\SobH[0]{1}(M) \subset \SobH{1}(M) \subset \Lp{2}(M)$.
We remark that without closability, if these spaces were obtained
via a completion with respect to the Sobolev norm, we could not 
assert that they were spaces of functions.

Another consequence of the closability, coupled with the 
fact that $\Ck[c]{\infty}(M)$ are dense in $\Lp{2}(M)$ 
is that $\nabla_2$ and $\nabla_c$ are densely-defined
operators. Therefore, operator theory yeilds 
that $\adj{\nabla_2}$ and $\adj{\nabla_c}$ exist
as densely-defined, closed operators. 
Moreover, when $g$ is smooth, we have that
$-\tr \nabla^{T^\ast M}_c  \subset \adj{\nabla_c}$, and
the Dirichlet Laplacian is then given by 
the expression $\Delta_{g,D} = \adj{\nabla_c}\close{\nabla_c}$. 


\begin{defn}
Let \(g\) be a rough metric on a smooth manifold \(M\). The \emph{Laplacian} \(\Delta_g : L^2_g(M) \to L^2_g(M)\) is defined by
\[
\Delta_g f = \nabla^{\ast}_g \nabla f.
\]
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
The Laplacian is (by definition) \(L^2_g\) self-adjoint:
\[
\ip{\Delta_g f}{h}_g = \int_M (\nabla^{\ast}_g \nabla f) h d\mu_g = \int_M g(\nabla f, \nabla h) d\mu_g = \int_M f \nabla^{\ast}_g \nabla h d\mu_g = \ip{f}{\Delta h}_g.
\]
Therefore, the heat semi-group
\[
e^{t \Delta} : L^2 \to L^2
\]
is defined for all \(t > 0\).
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
Let \(I \subset \R\) be an interval. A function \(u \in C^1(I \to W^{1,2}(M))\) solves the \emph{heat equation} if for each \(t \in I\),
\[
\partial_t u (\cdot, t) = \Delta u (\cdot, t)
\]
in \(W^{1,2}(M)\).
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
For any solution \(u\), of the heat equation, we have the representation formula
\[
u(x, t) = \left(e^{-t \Delta} u(\cdot, 0)\right) (x).
\]
\end{rem}
