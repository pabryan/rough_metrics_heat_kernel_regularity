\begin{itemize}
\item One approach is to work in a coordinate chart, where the metric is equivalent to a smooth one. Then the heat equation becomes a divergence form parabolic equation with measureable coefficients. Compare with the work of Salof-Coste here.
\item Another approach is to try to use functional analysis techniques applied to positive operators and cones to prove the Harnack. Compare with the work of Mondino on RCD spaces as well as the work of Hamilton and Wilking for the positive cone stuff.
\end{itemize}
