\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Let \(M\) be a smooth manifold. We consider \emph{rough metrics} on \(M\), the set of which we denote \(\met_{\rough} (M)\). These are metrics on \(M\) with measurable coefficients that are locally comparable to smooth smooth metrics (see \Cref{sec:rough_metrics}).

Our main theorem is the following:

\begin{thm}
On a smooth manifold \(M\), equipped with a rough metric \(g\), there exists a heat kernel \(\rho_t = \rho_t(g)\), such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\rho_t > 0\) for \(t > 0\),
\item on a parabolic cylinder \(Q = K \times [t_1, t_2]\) with \(0 < t_1 < t_2\), \(K \subseteq M\) is compact, there exists an \(\alpha = \alpha(Q)\) so that \(\rho_t \in C^{\alpha}(K \times K)\) for \(t_1 \leq t \leq t_2\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{The Harnack Inequality}
\label{sec:harnack}

\begin{itemize}
\item One approach is to work in a coordinate chart, where the metric is equivalent to a smooth one. Then the heat equation becomes a divergence form parabolic equation with measureable coefficients. Compare with the work of Salof-Coste here.
\item Another approach is to try to use functional analysis techniques applied to positive operators and cones to prove the Harnack. Compare with the work of Mondino on RCD spaces as well as the work of Hamilton and Wilking for the positive cone stuff.
\end{itemize}
