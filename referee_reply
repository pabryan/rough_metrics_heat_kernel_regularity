(1) Gave a more compelete comparision as asked. 
(2) Added more motivation for the study of non-smooth metrics by pointing out metrics coming from limits of Riemannian manifolds.
(3) Fixed this "classica" business. 
(4) Added that we actually prove this local weak harnack estimate. No geometry is needed. 
(5) Added a sentence to the end of the introduction about regularity - the lack of reliance on a distance strcuture in our arguments.  "Severe restriction" made clear - i.e., the existence of a metric with lower Ricci curvature bounds. 
(6) Changed this remark to show that it is neccessary in the way we prove the existence of the heat kernel. 
(7) Added the parts that need to be inspected in [SC92].
(8) Removed the "standard". It is simply the iteration process given by the Lemma.
